# Overview

When receiving feedback, assess if the feedback should be added to an existing rule or a new rule should be created. The goal is to avoid having repeat the same feedback over and over again.

## Best practices

Good rules are focused, actionable, and scoped.

Keep rules under 500 lines
- Split large rules into multiple, composable rules
- Provide concrete examples or referenced files
- Avoid vague guidance. Write rules like clear internal docs
- Reuse rules when repeating prompts in chat
- Reference files instead of copying their contents—this keeps rules short and prevents them from becoming stale as code changes

## What to avoid in rules
- Copying entire style guides: Use a linter instead. Agent already knows common style conventions.
- Documenting every possible command: Agent knows common tools like npm, git, and pytest.
- Adding instructions for edge cases that rarely apply: Keep rules focused on patterns you use frequently.
- Duplicating what's already in your codebase: Point to canonical examples instead of copying code.
