# Overview

We use Better Auth for authentication.

Consult the [Better Auth Documentation](https://better-auth.com/docs) for the available operations. Always follow best practices and documentation.

## Server vs Client
When working with auth on the server, use src/lib/auth.ts to authenticate requests.

When working with auth on the client, use src/lib/auth-client.ts to authenticate requests.
