# Overview

We use Server Components for components that need to be rendered on the server.

We use Client Components for components that need to be rendered on the client.

In general, we should use Server Components where possible. Anytime client reactivity is needed, we should use Client Components, but instead of making a large component a client component, we should split it into smaller components that are server components.
