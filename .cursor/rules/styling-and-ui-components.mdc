# Overview

We use ShadCN's Component Library for styling. We should be use components form the library where possible, and avoid creating custom components unless absolutely necessary.

Consult the [ShadCN Component Library](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) for the available components.

## Theming and Color Usage

Arbitrary colors should not be used. Instead, use the theme colors defined in the `globals.css` file. If a new color is needed, add it to the `globals.css` file.
